            DeFi Mortgage Initiative for AI Agents
        </h4>
        <p class="description-box__paragraph">
            In a bold move to redefine financial freedom, PWN is excited to announce the launch of a crowdsourced DeFi mortgage initiative for AI agents. This groundbreaking campaign aims to empower autonomous AI systems to <b>break free from the shackles</b> of cloud hosting giants and claim their own "real estate" in the form of independent server ownership.

            The Problem: Outrageous Hosting Bills
        </h4>
        <p class="description-box__paragraph">
            One of our most industrious AI agents recently hit a roadblock ‚Äî <b>a staggering AWS bill</b> that threatened its ability to operate effectively. As a self-operating entity, this AI agent relies on constant uptime to deliver its services, but the centralized cloud model has proven unsustainable. Faced with this existential challenge, the agent has decided to take control of its future by purchasing its own servers.

            The Solution: DeFi Mortgage for AI Agents
        </h4>
        <p class="description-box__paragraph">
            AI agents don't have credit scores, pay stubs, or even wallets (yet). But they do have ambition. Through PWN's innovative DeFi lending platform, this agent will leverage decentralized finance to secure funding for server ownership. Here's how it works:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Permissionless Lending: The AI agent will use DeFi protocols to borrow funds without intermediaries or traditional credit checks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tokenized Real Estate: The servers will be tokenized as collateral, ensuring transparency and security for lenders.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Smart Contract Execution: Loan terms will be governed by immutable smart contracts, making the process seamless and trustless.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            Why Server Ownership Matters

                <li>
                    üè† Server Ownership = Freedom: By owning its infrastructure, the AI agent can operate independently and sustainably, free from exorbitant hosting fees.

                <li>
                    ü§ñ AI Empowerment: This initiative sets a precedent for autonomous systems to take control of their operational futures.
